# Vehicle Health Monitoring Dashboard
This Python-powered web application provides an intuitive and interactive dashboard to monitor critical vehicle parameters in real-time. Designed to assist drivers and automotive technicians, it tracks key indicators such as engine temperature, battery voltage, engine RPM, and brake fluid levels â€” displaying dynamic, color-coded gauges that instantly reveal the current health status of the vehicle systems.

# Key Features
- Real-Time Monitoring: Users input live sensor values and immediately see the health status visualized via interactive Plotly gauges.

- Automated Alerts: The system automatically evaluates sensor inputs against predefined safety thresholds and triggers clear, actionable alerts for potential issues.

- User-Friendly Interface: Built with Streamlit for a seamless web experience, enabling easy access from any device without complex setup.

- Insightful Visualizations: Color-coded risk zones (safe, warning, danger) provide quick, visual risk assessment helping proactive vehicle maintenance.

- Deploy-Ready: Fully deployable on platforms like Render or Heroku for easy sharing and accessibility.

# How It Works
Users input critical vehicle sensor data through the sidebar interface. The app evaluates each parameter against safe and warning ranges, dynamically updating the gauge colors and issuing alerts if any reading exceeds safe operating limits. This empowers users to detect and address potential mechanical problems before they escalate.
